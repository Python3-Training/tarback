# Tarback Mission?
**Quickly back-up our Linux workstations using date-named archives.**

Greetings 'Pythoneers!

I wanted to share a handy little script that I created to help us back-up / archive our files. The ability to tally, archive, as well as to save recently-changed files into incrementally-named backups on our desktop, are the key benefits.

Designed to run wherever the `find` and `tar` commands are installed (Linux, Cygwin, MacOS, etc,) I hope you will find this code useful, as well as instructive. 

I've kept `tarback.py` for educational reasons - it works fine, but the latest version is `tarback2.py`. 

# MISSION: Customize tarback2.py before using!
* Add YOUR key folders (pun intended) to **Options**.`locations`.
* Define your default key in **Options**.`option`.
* Change **Options**.`DEFAULT_FOLDER` to YOUR backup location.
* (optional) Add to `cron` so as to run automatically?

I've more features to add (`tarback3`?) as time permits...

## Options.DEFAULT_ALL
Decades ago - when I was writing for BYTE Magazine - a fellow author mused that the reason WHY wee geeks have
such cool tools is because we actually USE what we CREATE?

In that spirit I hope you'll enjoy the new **DEFAULT_ALL** feature. Presently implemented as a 'key option' (yes, more puns :)
we can use that token whenever we want to 'Jedi' ('JUST DO IT') `all.`
